# Sudoku

A pretty nice sudoku app inspired by Cracking The Cryptic's [Website](https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/).

Play by clicking one of the buttons at the bottom of the screen! See how fast you can beat it!

## Controls:

- Press 1-9 to set the main number
- Hold ctrl while pressing to put corner notes
  - These can be removed by:
    - Pressing the same number again, OR
    - Entering a big number, OR
    - Pressing delete or backspace
- Hold shift while pressing to put center notes
  - These follow the same rules as corner notes

You can also click the remaining numbers below the grid to enter the number in the selected slot, OR
jump to the first occurance of that number.

That's just about it. Have fun!
